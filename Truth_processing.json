      "A rock for ages stern and high,",
      "Stood frowning ’gainst the earth and sky;",
      "And never bowed his haughty crest,",
      "When angry storms around him prest."
    ],
    [
      "Morn springing from the arms of night,",
      "Had often bathed his brow with light;",
      "And kissed the shadows from his face,",
      "With gentle love and tender grace."
    ],
    [
      "Day, pausing at the gates of rest,",
      "Smiled on him from the distant west,",
      "And from her throne the dark-browed night",
      "Threw ’round his path her softest light."
    ],
    [
      "And yet he stood unmoved and proud,",
      "Nor love, nor wrath his spirit bowed—",
      "He bared his brow to every blast,",
      "And scorned the tempest as it passed."
    ],
    [
      "One day a tiny, humble seed,",
      "The quickest eye would hardly heed",
      "Fell trembling at that stern rock’s base,",
      "And found a lowly hiding-place."
    ],
    [
      "A ray of light and drop of dew",
      "Came with a message kind and true—",
      "They told her of the world so bright,",
      "Its love, its joy, and rosy light;"
    ],
    [
      "And lured her from her hiding-place,",
      "To gaze upon earth’s glorious face;",
      "So peeping, timid, from the ground,",
      "She clasped the ancient rock around;"
