-ERU YH,

MRS. k. F. W. HARPER.

A rock for ages stern and high,

Stood frowning ’gainst the earth and sky;
And never bowed his haughty crest,
When angry storms around him prest.

Morn springing from the arms of night,
Had often bathed his brow with light;
And kissed the shadows from his face,
‘With gentle love and tender grace.

Day, pausing at the gates of rest,

Smiled on him from the distant west,

And from her throne the dark-browed night
Threw ’round his path her softest light.

And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
Nor love, nor wrath his spirit bowed—
He bared his brow to every blast,
And scorned the tempest as it passed.

One day a tiny, humble seed,

The quickest eye would hardly heed
Fell trembling at that stern rock’s base,
And found a lowly hiding-piace.

A ray of light and drop of dew
‘Came with a message kind and true—
They told her of the world so bright,
Its love, its joy, and rosy light;

And lured her from her hiding-place,
To gaze upon earth’s glorious face;
So peeping, timid, from the ground,
She clasped the ancient rock around;

And climbing up with childish grace

| She held him with a close embrace —
Her clinging was a thing of dread,

Bs Where’er she touched a fissure spread;

And he who’d breasted many a storm,
Stood frowning there, a mangled form;
So truth, dropped in the silent earth,

May seem a thing of little worth —

Till, spreading ’round some mighty wrong,
It saps its pillars proud and strong.

I CAN TRUST.

DANIEL WEBSTER DAVIS.

I can not see why trials come, When darkest clouds my sky o’erhang,
And sorrows follow thick and fast; And sadness seems to fill the land,
: I can not fathom His designs, I calmly trust his promise sweet,
Nor why my pleasures can not last, And cling to his ne’er-failing hand,
Nor why my hopes so soon are dust; And in lite’s darkest hour V’Il just
But I can trust. Look up and trust.

I know my life with him is safe,
And all things still must work for
good
\ To those who love and serve our God,
| And lean on him as children should.
Though hopes decay and turn to dust,
I still will trust.
