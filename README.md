# OCR-and-AI-Transcription-Project-8510

I will work with "The Colored American Magazine," a Black magazine publication advocating for the quest for Black identity and representation in the early 19th century. I chose this publication because it offers a manageable starting point for experimentation. I plan to select one issue of "The Colored American Magazine," download it as a PDF, convert it to images using pdf2images, and then run it through Tesseract to perform OCR. Once I have that text, I will use OpenAIâ€™s GPT-5-nano to process and interpret the text. I am particularly interested in observing how the model handles text with imperfect OCR, where it might help clarify content, but also where it could distort images or have offensive language.
